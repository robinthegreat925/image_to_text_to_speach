### 🧠 Image-to-Speech Word Explorer

Turn an image into a spoken word — with definitions, part of speech, and pronunciation powered by AI.

---

#### 📸 What It Does

This Python program:

1. Takes an uploaded image (e.g., of a dog or apple)
2. Uses a vision model (`transformers` pipeline) to classify the image
3. Uses **NLTK WordNet** to:

   * Get the definition
   * Identify the part of speech
   * List synonyms
4. Uses **gTTS** to:

   * Convert the word and definition into speech
   * Play the result directly in the notebook

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component         | Library/Tool Used                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Image Classifier  | `transformers` (Vision Transformer pipeline) |
| Lexical Knowledge | `nltk.corpus.wordnet`                        |
| Text-to-Speech    | `gTTS` + `IPython.display.Audio`             |
| Image Upload      | `google.colab.files.upload()`                |

#### 🚀 How to Run (in Google Colab)

1. **Install required packages:**

```python
!pip install transformers gtts nltk
```

2. **Download WordNet:**

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

3. **Upload an image file:**

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

4. **Run the classifier + TTS pipeline**

```python
# Classifies the image and speaks the definition
```

#### 🎯 Example Output

> 📷 **Input Image:** Apple
> 🎓 **Detected Word:** apple
> 📖 **Definition:** Fruit with red or green skin and a whitish interior
> 🗣️ **Audio Output:** Automatically spoken using gTTS

#### 🧠 Future Ideas

* Add syllable breakdown using CMU Pronouncing Dictionary
* Highlight stress and intonation rules
* Animate mouth or lips for each syllable
* Build a GUI to drop images and hear sounds
